# GuessingGame (workshop exercise)

It is a simple terminal app, in which the computer generates a random number within a given range. The user's goal is to
guess the number in a given number of tries. The program can validate the inputs. It also shows whether a guess is too
small or too big, which allows the user to guess the final number. The game ends when the user runs out of attempts or
guesses the number. Below is an example of a console output:

```
